    Hi Wallapop, nice to meet you!

  <p class="f5 f4-ns">
    I am Cecilia, a regular user of your app, and I love the concept of it. I've seen constant 
    improvements in the app, adding many features like alerts, activity status in chat, deliveries, 
    and visual enhancements, to mention a few. I also noticed that the desktop version got refreshed, 
    getting paired in features with the app.
  </p>
  <p class="f5 f4-ns mb5">
    I would love to be part of this exciting flow, building and contributing to all these new features 
    and join the team as a Product Designer.
