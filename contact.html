      Hello, my name is Cecilia and this is my work.<br>
      I love digital design, illustrating <span class="lato">&</span> playing with code.

      I am a curious person, always positive and eager to learn. 
      I enjoy team working, as much as helping others. The process I go through from users' needs 
      until I reach the best solution is what really encourages me. 
      I believe in quality, taking data-driven decisions with the right balance between results 
      and the influence of good design.

    <p class="w-80-ns mid-gray f5 f4-ns">
      If you enjoyed looking at my work as much as I've liked creating it, 
      have a question, or want to say hello, drop me a line.
