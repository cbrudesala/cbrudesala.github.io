      Hello, my name is Cecilia and this is my work.<br>
      I love digital design, illustrating <span class="lato">&</span> playing with code.

      I'm a curious person, always positive and eager to learn.
      I cherish working in teams, as much as I do helping others.
      What drives me is the path one goes along from a problem, to reach the greatest solution.
      I believe in quality, taking data-driven decisions with a good balance between results and good design.
      <!--Understand the problem, get to the heart of the matter, test it, get the
       data and then (above everything) simplify it by making things easier.-->
