  Hello, my name is Cecilia and this is my work.<br>
  I love digital design, illustrating <span class="lato">&</span> playing with code.
</p>


<p class="w-60 mid-gray f3">
  I’m a curious person, always positive with a smile on my face and a data lover.
  I love working and helping teams;



  surrounded of developers, data scientist and fellow designers.

  What I like the most is the path one goes along to find the greatest solution.
  Understand the problem, get to the heart of the matter, test it, get the data and then (above everything) simplify it by making things easier.
