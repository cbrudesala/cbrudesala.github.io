description: >
    Clotilde Barcelona is Rosa Alloza's personal project. After more than 20 years working in the fashion industry, she
    decided to open her own store.
    Working together, we built a brand that sought great quality, elegance and personality.
    Looking for a timeless visual identity, the design can be used not only as a corporate image but also in a
    more decorative way.
