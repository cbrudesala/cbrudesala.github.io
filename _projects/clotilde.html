description: Branding tienda de ropa. It’s not what you win but how you conquer it – this phrase set the tone for a competition during the London Olympics in 2012, hosted by Conqueror Papers. The brief was to create typographic posters in the context of sports. Existing glyphs from the Futura typeface were exclusively manipulated by the use of colours and symbolise different sporting disciplines.
