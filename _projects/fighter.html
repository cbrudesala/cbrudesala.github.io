    Banner Fighter is a game I made after working with banner for a while.
    This is the story about how I started creating and coding small little creatives.
    After that, I wanted to share all the lessons learned with the rest of the company and improve my coding skills.
    So, what a better way to do it than making a little game.

<p>
  Creatives are one of the key parts of RTB (Real-Time Bidding).
  It's the only UI with the user, what’s in front of a very complicated system.
  On an average month, we had (you can have/ there are?) over 300M of impressions.
  And that’s a lot!
  Since the project started, we created over 800 creatives for 14 different sizes.
  What started trying to combine good-looking creatives with data-driven decisions, became many different options.
  We went from an average 0.2% CTR to over 1.0%! That’s a really high number in Display and the Programmatic land.
  Below you can see the progression plus other insights.
