  RTB Dashboard was an internal tool in our team, used to visualize all the relevant data and configure some
  parts of the system. I was involved on a daily basis with the rest of the team, so I took this opportunity to design
  and implement pages with first-hand impressions and direct feedback.

  The challenge here was to digest a huge amount of data (+25 GB/day).
  We wanted to show it in a way that was easy to understand, rapid and customizable.
  This web app was a key part in decision making and day-to-day operations.
  We combined charts with data tables, being very pesky chosing what to show and how.

  What started as a small dashboard, it became the place to go for anything data related.
  It was a team effort, there wasn't an owner of the project and everyone was responsible for it.
  I used this approach to gather feedback and evolve many pages, adding tiny details and changing workflows
  to make things easier to use.

  Over time, more people in other areas were using the Dashboard. This complicated things a bit, we had to widen the
  scope and run the extra mile so anyone could understand some key pages.

We ended up with a very complete UI Toolbox, that allowed us to iterate rapidly and honor an unwritten
motto we had:
  <i>If you can't see, use or understand the data, it's like it's not there.</i>
