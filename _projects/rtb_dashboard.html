  RTB Dashboard was an internal tool in our team, used to visualize all the relevant data and configure some
  parts of the system. I was involved on a daily basis with the rest of the team, so I took this opportunity to design
  and implement pages with first-hand impressions and direct feedback.

  The challenge here was to digest a huge amount of data (+25 GB/day) and show it
  in a way that was fast, easy to understand and customizable.
  This web app was a key part in decision making and day-to-day operations.
  We combined charts with data tables, being very pesky chosing what to show and how.

  What started as a small dashboard, it became the place to go for anything data related.
  It was a team effort, there wasn't an owner of the project and everyone was responsible for it.
  I used this approach to gather feedback and evolve many pages, adding tiny details and changing workflows
  to make things easier to use.

<h3 class="mid-gray mb4 tc w-70 center f3 f2-ns">A more open Dashboard</h3>
<p class="mid-gray f4 mb4 tc w-70 center">
  Over time, more people in other areas were using the Dashboard. This complicated things a bit, we had to widen the
  scope and run the extra mile so anyone could understand some key pages.
