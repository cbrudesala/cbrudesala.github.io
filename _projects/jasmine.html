  Falling Jasmine is a jewerly collection which was born from the collaboration between
  Carolina Herrera and the argentinian artist Grillo Demo.
  For the launch, I was asked to create the logo for the collection and also to retouch Carolina Herrera's promotion image
  so it would fit different markets.
