  Site created for the beta launch of Rocket, an RTB product which retargeted users offering customised creatives for each client.
  We wanted to involve partners in the early stages of product development to gather data, identify needs and get
  first-hand feedback.
  I was part of the whole process, from concept to design and implementation.
  This page was responsive, integrated in Trovit's Partners platform.
