  Over time, more people in other areas were using the Dashboard. This complicated things a bit, we had to widen the
  scope and run the extra mile so anyone could understand some key metrics.

  What started as a small dashboard, it became the place to go for anything data related.
  It was a team effort, there wasn't an owner of the project and everyone was responsible for it.
  I used this approach to gather feedback and evolve many pages, adding tiny details and changing workflows
  to make things easier to use.
