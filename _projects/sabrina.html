  Delivery Mates is a British company with extensive experience in distribution and logistic. 
   This software is used to control last-mile deliveries from different companies. Initially it was 
   an internal tool, but later it became a B2B product used by different partners. Depending on their needs, 
   each partner had access to a more straightforward or more sophisticated version. As the software 
   grew fast and having different kinds of deliveries made our software more complex. To offer an excellent
   and consistent experience, we built a design system that helped us streamline all scenarios.
