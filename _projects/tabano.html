description: >
  New publishing house of philosophy books.
  The publishers asked me to build the brand identity as well as the book design (cover and interior).
  One of the challenges was that aesthetics should not distract the reader.
  Furthermore, the design ensures that no book stands out more than any other
  when the whole collection is placed on a bookcase.
