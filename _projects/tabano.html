  New publishing house of philosophy books.
  The publishers asked me to build the brand identity as well as the editorial design (cover and book interior).
  One of the challenges was that aesthetics should not distract the reading but would accompany it.
  Furthermore, the collection ensures that no book stands out above another once they were placed in a bookcase.
